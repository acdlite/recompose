Recompose is a React utility belt for function components and higher-order components. Think of it like lodash for React.

```
npm install recompose --save
```

## You can use Recompose to...

### ...lift state into functional wrappers

Helpers like `withState()` and `withReducer()` provide a nicer way to express state updates:

```js
const Counter = withState(
  'counter', 'setCounter', 0,
  ({ counter, setCounter }) => (
    <div>
      Count: {counter}
      <button onClick={() => setCounter(n => n + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCounter(n => n - 1)}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  )
)
```

Or with a Redux-style reducer:

```js
const counterReducer = (count, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
  case INCREMENT:
    return count + 1
  case DECREMENT:
    return count - 1
  default:
    return count
  }
}

const Counter = withReducer(
  'count', 'dispatch', counterReducer, 0,
  ({ counter, dispatch }) => (
    <div>
      Count: {counter}
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: INCREMENT })}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: DECREMENT })}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  )
)
```

### ...perform the most common React patterns

Helpers like `componentFromProp()` and `withContext()` encapsulate common React patterns into a simple functional interface:

```js
const Button = defaultProps(
  { component: 'button' },
  componentFromProp('component')
)

<Button /> // renders <button>
<Button component={Link} /> // renders <Link />
```

```js
const provide = store => withContext(
  { store: PropTypes.object },
  () => { store }
  // We've left out final `BaseComponent` param
  // Because of currying, `provide` is a higher-order component
)

// Apply to base component
// Descendants of App have access to context.store
const AppWithContext = provide(App)
```

### ...optimize rendering performance

No need to write a new class just to implement `shouldComponentUpdate()`. Recompose helpers like `pure()` and `onlyUpdateForKeys()` do this for you:

```js
// A component that is expensive to render
const ExpensiveComponent = ({ propA, propB }) => {...}

// Optimized version of same component, using shallow comparison of props
// Same effect as React's PureRenderMixin
const OptimizedComponent = pure(ExpensiveComponent)

// Even more optimized: only updates if specific prop keys have changed
const HyperOptimizedComponent = onlyUpdateForKeys(['propA', 'propB'], ExpensiveComponent)
```

### ...interoperate with other libraries

Recompose helpers integrate really nicely with external libraries like Relay, Redux, and RxJS

```js
const Post = compose(
  // This is a curried version of Relay.createContainer(), provided by recompose-relay
  createContainer({
    fragments: {
      post: () => Relay.QL`
        fragment on Post {
          title,
          content
        }
      `
    }
  }),
  flattenProp('post')
)(({ title, content }) => (
  <article>
    <h1>{title}</h1>
    <div>{content}</div>
  </article>
))
```

### ...build your own libraries

Many React libraries end up implementing the same utilities over and over again, like `shallowEqual()` and `getDisplayName()`. Recompose provides these utilities for you.

```js
// Any Recompose module can be imported individually
import getDisplayName from 'recompose/getDisplayName'
ConnectedComponent.displayName = `connect(${getDisplayName(BaseComponent)})`

// Or, even better:
import wrapDisplayName from 'recompose/wrapDisplayName'
ConnectedComponent.displayName = wrapDisplayName(BaseComponent, 'connect')

import toClass from 'recompose/toClass'
// Converts a function component to a class component, e.g. so it can be given
// a ref. Returns class components as is.
const ClassComponent = toClass(FunctionComponent)
```

## API docs

[Read them here](docs/API.md)

## Why

Forget ES6 classes vs. `createClass()`.

An idiomatic React application consists mostly of function components.

```js
const Greeting = props => (
  <p>
    Hello, {props.name}!
  </p>
);
```

Function components have several key advantages:

- They prevent abuse of the `setState()` API, favoring props instead.
- They're simpler, and less error-prone.
- They encourage the "smart" vs. "dumb" component pattern.
- They encourage code that is more reusable and modular.
- They discourage giant, complicated components that do too many things.
- In the future, they will allow React to make performance optimizations by avoiding unnecessary checks and memory allocations.

The practice of writing small, pure, reusable components is sometimes called **microcomponentization**.

(Note that although Recompose encourages the use of function components whenever possible, it works with normal React components as well.)

### Higher-order components made easy

Most of the time when we talk about composition in React, we're talking about composition of components. For example, a `<Blog>` component may be composed of many `<Post>` components, which are composed of many `<Comment>` components.

However, that's only the beginning. Recompose focuses on another unit of composition: **higher-order components** (HoCs). HoCs are functions that accept a base component and return a new component with additional functionality. They can be used to abstract common tasks into reusable pieces.

Recompose provides a toolkit of helper functions for creating higher-order components. Most of these helpers are themselves are higher-order components. You can compose the helpers together to make new HoCs, or apply them to a base component.

## [Should I use this? Performance and other concerns](docs/performance.md)

## Usage

All functions are available on the top-level export.

```js
import { compose, mapProps, withState /* ... */ } from 'recompose';
```

### Optimizing bundle size

You can reduce your bundle size by only including the modules that you need.

All top-level exports can be imported individually:

```js
import compose from 'recompose/compose';
import mapProps from 'recompose/mapProps';
import withState from 'recompose/withState';
// ... and so on
```

This is a good option for library authors who don't want to bloat their bundle sizes.

Recompose depends on certain lodash modules, like `curry` and `compose`. If you're already using lodash, then the net bundle increase from using Recompose will be even smaller.

## Features

### Automatic currying

Recompose functions are component-last and curried by default. This makes them easy to compose:

```js
const BaseComponent = props => {...};

// This will work, but it's tedious
let ContainerComponent = onWillReceiveProps(..., BaseComponent);
ContainerComponent = mapProps(..., ContainerComponent);
ContainerComponent = withState(..., ContainerComponent);

// Do this instead
// Note that the order has reversed — props flow from top to bottom
const ContainerComponent = compose(
  withState(...),
  mapProps(...),
  onWillReceiveProps(...)
)(BaseComponent);
```

Technically, this also means you can use them as decorators (if that's your thing):

```js
@withState(...)
@mapProps(...)
@onWillReceiveProps(...)
class Component extends React.Component {...}
```

### Helpful warnings in development

If you use the `compose()` method provided by Recompose, it will print a warning if a higher-order component helper has insufficient parameters. For example, if you forget to pass an initial state to `withReducer()`:

```js
compose(
  withReducer('state', 'dispatch', reducer), // Forgot initialState
  ...otherHelpers
)(BaseComponent)
```

> Attempted to compose `withReducer()` with other higher-order component helpers, but it has been applied with 1 too few parameters. Check the implementation of \<BaseComponent\>.
