Recompose is a React utility belt for function components and higher-order components. Think of it like lodash for React.

## You can use Recompose to...

### ...lift state into functional wrappers

Helpers like `withState()` and `withReducer()` provide a nicer way to express state updates:

```js
const Counter = withState(
  'counter', 'setCounter', 0
)(({ counter, setCounter }) => (
    <div>
      Count: {counter}
      <button onClick={() => setCounter(n => n + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCounter(n => n - 1)}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  )
)
```

Or with a Redux-style reducer:

```js
const counterReducer = (count, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
  case INCREMENT:
    return count + 1
  case DECREMENT:
    return count - 1
  default:
    return count
  }
}

const Counter = withReducer(
  'counter', 'dispatch', counterReducer, 0
)(({ counter, dispatch }) => (
    <div>
      Count: {counter}
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: INCREMENT })}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: DECREMENT })}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  )
)
```

### ...perform the most common React patterns

Helpers like `componentFromProp()` and `withContext()` encapsulate common React patterns into a simple functional interface:

```js
const Button = defaultProps({ component: 'button' })(componentFromProp('component'))

<Button /> // renders <button>
<Button component={Link} /> // renders <Link />
```

```js
const provide = store => withContext(
  { store: PropTypes.object },
  () => { store }
)

// Apply to base component
// Descendants of App have access to context.store
const AppWithContext = provide(store)(App)
```

### ...optimize rendering performance

No need to write a new class just to implement `shouldComponentUpdate()`. Recompose helpers like `pure()` and `onlyUpdateForKeys()` do this for you:

```js
// A component that is expensive to render
const ExpensiveComponent = ({ propA, propB }) => {...}

// Optimized version of same component, using shallow comparison of props
// Same effect as React's PureRenderMixin
const OptimizedComponent = pure(ExpensiveComponent)

// Even more optimized: only updates if specific prop keys have changed
const HyperOptimizedComponent = onlyUpdateForKeys(['propA', 'propB'])(ExpensiveComponent)
```

### ...interoperate with other libraries

Recompose helpers integrate really nicely with external libraries like Relay, Redux, and RxJS

```js
const Post = compose(
  // This is a curried version of Relay.createContainer(), provided by recompose-relay
  createContainer({
    fragments: {
      post: () => Relay.QL`
        fragment on Post {
          title,
          content
        }
      `
    }
  }),
  flattenProp('post')
)(({ title, content }) => (
  <article>
    <h1>{title}</h1>
    <div>{content}</div>
  </article>
))
```

### ...build your own libraries

Many React libraries end up implementing the same utilities over and over again, like `shallowEqual()` and `getDisplayName()`. Recompose provides these utilities for you.

```js
// Any Recompose module can be imported individually
import getDisplayName from 'recompose/getDisplayName'
ConnectedComponent.displayName = `connect(${getDisplayName(BaseComponent)})`

// Or, even better:
import wrapDisplayName from 'recompose/wrapDisplayName'
ConnectedComponent.displayName = wrapDisplayName(BaseComponent, 'connect')

import toClass from 'recompose/toClass'
// Converts a function component to a class component, e.g. so it can be given
// a ref. Returns class components as is.
const ClassComponent = toClass(FunctionComponent)
```

### ...and more

## API docs

[Read them here](docs/API.md)

## Why

Forget ES6 classes vs. `createClass()`.

An idiomatic React application consists mostly of function components.

```js
const Greeting = props => (
  <p>
    Hello, {props.name}!
  </p>
);
```

Function components have several key advantages:

- They prevent abuse of the `setState()` API, favoring props instead.
- They encourage the ["smart" vs. "dumb" component pattern](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0).
- They encourage code that is more reusable and modular.
- They discourage giant, complicated components that do too many things.
- In the future, they will allow React to make performance optimizations by avoiding unnecessary checks and memory allocations.

(Note that although Recompose encourages the use of function components whenever possible, it works with normal React components as well.)

### Higher-order components made easy

Most of the time when we talk about composition in React, we're talking about composition of components. For example, a `<Blog>` component may be composed of many `<Post>` components, which are composed of many `<Comment>` components.

Recompose focuses on another unit of composition: **higher-order components** (HoCs). HoCs are functions that accept a base component and return a new component with additional functionality. They can be used to abstract common tasks into reusable pieces.

Recompose provides a toolkit of helper functions for creating higher-order components.

## [Should I use this? Performance and other concerns](docs/performance.md)

## Usage

All functions are available on the top-level export.

```js
import { compose, mapProps, withState /* ... */ } from 'recompose';
```

### Composition

Recompose helpers are designed to be composable:

```js
const BaseComponent = props => {...};

// This will work, but it's tedious
let EnhancedComponent = pure(BaseComponent);
EnhancedComponent = mapProps(/*...args*/)(EnhancedComponent);
EnhancedComponent = withState(/*...args*/)(EnhancedComponent);

// Do this instead
// Note that the order has reversed — props flow from top to bottom
const EnhancedComponent = compose(
  withState(/*...args*/),
  mapProps(/*...args*/),
  pure
)(BaseComponent);
```

Technically, this also means you can use them as decorators (if that's your thing):

```js
@withState(/*...args*/)
@mapProps(/*...args*/)
@pure
class Component extends React.Component {...}
```

### Optimizing bundle size

You can reduce your bundle size by only including the modules that you need.

All top-level exports can be imported individually:

```js
import compose from 'recompose/compose';
import mapProps from 'recompose/mapProps';
import withState from 'recompose/withState';
// ... and so on
```

This is a good option for library authors who don't want to bloat their bundle sizes.

Recompose depends on certain lodash modules, like `compose`. If you're already using lodash, then the net bundle increase from using Recompose will be even smaller.
